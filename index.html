then they, too, became agitated; Gregor's father, standing to the right of his mother, accused her of not leaving the cleaning of Gregor's room to his sister; from her left, Gregor's sister screamed at her that she was never to clean Gregor's room again; while his mother tried to draw his father, who was beside himself with anger, into the bedroom; his sister, quaking with tears, thumped on the table with her small fists; and Gregor hissed in anger that no-one had even thought of closing the door to save him the sight of this and all its noise.", 'establish,friendly,relations,with,them': "' If we can establish friendly relations with them, though, the  weather may be ours, if that be desirable!", 'not,bind,herself,in,any': 'Your father and I have agreed that she shall not bind herself in any way, nor be married, before twenty.', 'difficulties,were,necessary,to,increase': 'And if difficulties were necessary to increase the splendor of the effort, what could be harder for a restless, ambitious girl than to give up her own hopes, plans, and desires, and cheerfully live for others?', 'refuge,in,which,several,strange': 'The rooms of his house became a sort of harbour of refuge in which several strange battered hulks found their last moorings.', 'ascends,to,the,divine,perfection': 'By the right choice and true application of thought, man ascends to the Divine Perfection;

but no man is so brave that he may not meet such defeats and disasters as to discourage him and dampen his ardor for any cause, no matter how just he deems it.", 'ready,to,overflow,the,new': 'It may be taken as a striking example of the purpose and design which run through the affairs of men, that at the very moment when the old world was ready to overflow the new world was empty to receive it.', 'mentioned,as,having,committed,in': 'He commanded a corps longer than any other one, and his name was never mentioned as having committed in battle a blunder for which he was responsible.', 'contents,of,our,own,minds': 'But for our acquaintance with the contents of our own minds, we should be unable to imagine the minds of others, and therefore we could never arrive at the knowledge that they have minds.', 'telling,the,same,pitiful,story': 'Isekansu shows his stump of a forearm, telling the     same pitiful story.', 'indicates,a,high,degree,of': "Seriously to suggest that a  visit to a cinema show and the use of an apt illustration implies  'a very considerable knowledge of photography' is on a par with the  supposition that to be employed as an errand girl and help in a shop  indicates a high degree of skill in that profession!", 'to,enter,when,he,received': '\' With these thrilling words he rushed away, and flinging open the door of the mauve salon, was about to enter, when he received..."  "A stunning blow from the big Greek lexicon, which an old fellow in a black gown fired at him," said Ned.', 'they,address,themselves,to,all': 'All the systems of morals which address themselves with a view to their "happiness," as it is called--what else are they but suggestions for behaviour adapted to the degree of DANGER from themselves in which the individuals live; recipes for their passions, their good and bad propensities, insofar as such have the Will to Power and would like to play the master; small and great expediencies and elaborations, permeated with the musty odour of old family medicines and old-wife wisdom; all of them grotesque and absurd in their form--because they address themselves to "all," because they generalize where generalization is not authorized; all of them speaking unconditionally, and taking themselves unconditionally; all of them flavoured not merely with one grain of salt, but rather endurable only, and sometimes even seductive, when they are over-spiced and begin to smell dangerously, especially of "the other world.', 'telling,the,story,at,home': '" thought Jo, as she was marched away, while her eyes danced with fun as she imagined herself telling the story at home.', 'months,with,all,the,witnesses': "As a prosecution     would have entailed his going to Lusambo, a fifteen days' journey,     with every prospect of being kept there some four to six months with     all the witnesses while awaiting the hearing of his case, he chose the     latter method.", 'are,just,as,obvious,as': 'When some of them have been granted, others can be proved, though these others, so long as they are simple, are just as obvious as the principles taken for granted.', 'who,served,under,him,and': 'He gained the confidence of all who served under him, and almost their love.', 'the,lower,corner,of,the': '"I merely wish to say, that as a slight token of my gratitude for the honor done me, and as a means of promoting friendly relations between adjoining nations, I have set up a post office in the hedge in the lower corner of the garden, a fine, spacious building with padlocks on the doors and every convenience for the mails, also the females, if I may be allowed the expression.', 'was,off,with,his,dogs': "'On my second visit Linton seemed in lively spirits; and Zillah (that is their housekeeper) made us a clean room and a good fire, and told us that, as Joseph was out at a prayer-meeting and Hareton Earnshaw was off with his dogs--robbing our woods of pheasants, as I heard afterwards--we might do what we liked.", 'the,right,to,include,within': 'In all willing it is absolutely a question of commanding and obeying, on the basis, as already said, of a social structure composed of many "souls", on which account a philosopher should claim the right to include willing-as-such within the sphere of morals--regarded as the doctrine of the relations of supremacy under which the phenomenon of "life" manifests itself.', 'stopped,and,gathered,in,a': 'The men stopped and gathered in a yard which faced a high building.', 'to,venture,to,deny,the': "It is as though some well-meaning person, who     had heard that a certain fashionable firm was making a fortune by     sweated labour, were to venture to deny the facts because a cursory     visit to the West End establishment showed that the salesmen behind     the counter were well-dressed and well-nourished, ignoring altogether     the festering misery of the sweaters' dens in which every article sold     over that counter was made up.", 'remain,in,ignorance,of,his': "'     CHAPTER XX   To obviate the danger of this threat being fulfilled, Mr. Linton commissioned me to take the boy home early, on Catherine's pony; and, said he--'As we shall now have no influence over his destiny, good or bad, you must say nothing of where he is gone to my daughter: she cannot associate with him hereafter, and it is better for her to remain in ignorance of his proximity; lest she should be restless, and anxious to visit the Heights.", 'the,protection,of,the,loyal': "Dispatches were constantly coming, urging me to do something for Burnside's relief; calling attention to the importance of holding East Tennessee; saying the President was much concerned for the protection of the loyal people in that section, etc.", 'she,had,given,a,last': 'Jo uttered a groan and fell back in her chair, remembering that she had given a last hasty powdering to the berries out of one of the two boxes on the kitchen table, and had neglected to put the milk in the refrigerator.', 'advantage,on,the,morning,of': 'We gained an advantage on the morning of the 6th, which, if it had been followed up, must have proven very decisive.', 'her,simply,because,she,was': 'They disliked her, but had been taught to be kind to her, simply because she was old and poor and had few friends.', 'and,hastened,to,make,everything': 'When he grew to manhood, Quelala, as he was called, was said to be the best and wisest man in all the land, while his manly beauty was so great that Gayelette loved him dearly, and hastened to make everything ready for the wedding.', 'the,rich,scent,of,the': 'I smelt the rich scent of the heating spices; and admired the shining kitchen utensils, the polished clock, decked in holly, the silver mugs ranged on a tray ready to be filled with mulled ale for supper; and above all, the speckless purity of my particular care--the scoured and well-swept floor.', 'and,supported,by,a,thick': 'He was quite short and stout and had a big head, which was flat at the top and supported by a thick neck full of wrinkles.', 'busy,with,his,books,and': "The war is over, and Mr. March safely at home, busy with his books and the small parish which found in him a minister by nature as by grace, a quiet, studious man, rich in the wisdom that is better than learning, the charity which calls all mankind 'brother', the piety that blossoms into character, making it august and lovely.", 'on,the,face,of,the': 'Every Linton on the face of the earth might melt into nothing before I could consent to forsake Heathcliff.', 'it,was,the,name,of': "On coming back a few days afterwards (for I did not consider my banishment perpetual), I found they had christened him 'Heathcliff': it was the name of a son who died in childhood, and it has served him ever since, both for Christian and surname.", 'but,it,was,a,little': '"  I laughed all the way downstairs, but it was a little pathetic, also to think of the poor man having to mend his own clothes.', 'that,there,was,a,good': 'CHAPTER VII  SOME SUBSEQUENT CASES   From the foregoing chapter it will be clear that there was a good deal of evidence which cannot easily be brushed aside as to the existence of these little creatures before the discovery of the photographs.', 'at,the,sight,of,him': "I'm used to rough work; but I fairly turned sick at the sight of him.", 'it,would,not,have,been': 'The land was so low and wet that it would not have been practicable to march an army across but for a levee.', 'but,it,was,a,very': '"I\'ll try, but it was a very ungentlemanly thing to do, I didn\'t think you could be so sly and malicious, Laurie," replied Meg, trying to hide her maidenly confusion under a gravely reproachful air.', 'he,did,not,want,to': 'So now Gregor was shut out from his mother, who, because of him, might be near to death; he could not open the door if he did not want to chase his sister away, and she had to stay with his mother; there was nothing for him to do but wait; and, oppressed with anxiety and self-reproach, he began to crawl about, he crawled over everything, walls, furniture, ceiling, and finally in his confusion as the whole room began to spin around him he fell down into the middle of the dinner table.', 'is,not,one,of,the': "If Socrates is not one of the men on whom our induction is based, we shall still do better to argue straight from our A, B, C, to Socrates, than to go round by the general proposition, 'all men are mortal'.", 'he,did,not,know,it': '"He told us nothing of all this last night," said she, laughing, "or even this morning at breakfast; but perhaps he did not know it himself.'}
